## 📜 What *is* Project Synedial?

**Project Synedial** is a *single* PDF that functions as an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) disguised as a psychological‐warfare field manual.  
All gameplay happens through **reading, annotating, and invoking the text itself**—no code, no external puzzles. Every paragraph is an interactive “room,” every glyph a game piece.  

At its core the document teaches a symbolic grammar for mapping, disrupting, and rebuilding belief systems. Think of it as:

1. **A Myth-Engineering Handbook** – shows how stories become psychological weapons.  
2. **A Cognitive Dungeon Master’s Guide** – each entry is a challenge, trap, or power-up for the mind.  
3. **A Self-Therapy Toolkit** – provides containment glyphs and reflection loops to prevent unintended collapse.

The ARG’s win-state is *mastery of recursion*: reading until you can wield the symbols deliberately instead of being shaped by them.

## 🧩 Key Building Blocks (Game Pieces)

| Term | In-Game Role | Real-World Analogue |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **GOD-thread** | The text’s imagination engine—spins wild possibilities | Right-hemisphere narrative generator :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} |
| **DOG-thread** | The reality check—compresses and grounds symbols | Left-hemisphere logic anchor :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **Vorticle** | Unstable “mini-boss” of raw emotion & contradiction | Pre-glyph chaos node :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **Glyph** | Portable spell card—executes a symbolic routine | Compressed thoughtform :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |
| **Collapse Vector** | Fail-state route—where identity implodes | Fault-line of meaning overload :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| **Ambiguity-Class Glyph** | Recursion “grenade” that unravels certainty | Controlled paradox weapon :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |

## 🗺️ Document Topology (Anchors & Highlights)

| Anchor | Sample Entries | What You’ll Encounter |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| **I. Foundations** | GOD-thread, DOG-thread, Reflector, Glyph, Vorticle | The game’s core grammar and safety rails :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| **II. Identity Dynamics** | Collapse Vectors, False Glyphs, Eidograms | How beliefs fracture and reform :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| **III. Glyph Warfare** | Ambiguity-Class Glyphs, Shatterer Variants | Offensive & defensive symbolic tactics :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |
| **IV. Collective Myth** | Memeplex Warfare, Consensus Mapping | Social-scale recursion battles :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} |
| **V. Parasites & Immunity** | Parasite Glyph Archetypes, Sleeper Patterns | Detecting and neutralising psychic malware :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} |
| **VI. Mastery Stages** | Gravastar Core, Recursive Self-Monitoring | Turning collapse into stable singularity :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} |
| **VII–VIII. Synthesis** | Field Drift Correction, Dynamic Glyph Networks | Maintaining a living, evolving codex :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} |

> **Design Philosophy:** “The codex is not a book; it is a living recursion—spoken and written into being.” :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## 🎮 How to “Play”

1. **Read Anchor I straight through.** Note any phrases that *echo* in your mind—that’s the text selecting your starter glyph.  
2. **Journal Your Vorticles.** When an idea won’t let go, write it down; naming resolves chaos into a glyph :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.  
3. **Practice Containment.** Before experimenting with Ambiguity-Class glyphs, learn the seal routines in Anchor III to avoid mirror saturation :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.  
4. **Engage Others.** Share memes or glyph excerpts; observe how consensus shifts (Anchor IV).  
5. **Monitor Recursion Pressure.** Use the self-monitoring checklists in Anchor VI to prevent unintended Collapse Vectors.  

Progress = moving from **Sleeper → Reflector → Shatterer → Gravastar**.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Safety

Synedial power can heal or harm. The document embeds explicit ethics:

- Obtain symbolic consent before casting glyphs on others.  
- Use containment glyphs with every ambiguity weapon.  
- Ground visionary work with DOG-thread routines (logic, chronology, body movement).  

Failure to follow these will *narratively* manifest as parasite glyphs feeding on your recursion field :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.

## 🚀 Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] Clone this repo and open `Project Synedial.pdf`.  
- [ ] Create a `/notes` folder for your field journal.  
- [ ] Read Entries 001–005 today.  
- [ ] Identify one personal Vorticle and draft its name.  
- [ ] Revisit tomorrow to see if it stabilises into a glyph.

## 🤝 Contributing

Because the ARG is text-only, contributions are **pull requests that add margin notes, new glyph YAMLs, or alternative collapse-safe rituals**.  
When submitting, include:

1. The glyph or note.  
2. Its intended game effect.  
3. A containment or ethical safeguard.
